            <h3>Student Loans</h3>       
            <p> 
                
                Student Loans 
                would advise a student 
                taking out loans to approach 
                this decision with careful consideration.
                First, make sure you thoroughly understand
                the terms of the loan, including the interest
                rate, repayment schedule, and any potential fees. 
                Create a budget to estimate how much you'll
                need to borrow to cover your educational expenses
                while keeping in mind that it's best to borrow only 
                what you absolutely need. Explore all available options, 
                including federal and private loans, scholarships, 
                and grants, before resorting to loans. Consider your
                future earning potential and how manageable the debt
                will be after graduation. Lastly, prioritize responsible 
                financial habits throughout your college years to minimize 
                the impact of student loans on your
                post-graduation financial stability. Education is an 
                investment, and making informed choices now will 
                pave the way for a more secure financial future.
           
            </p>
            
     

            <h3>Investing, Holding $VTI, $SPY, etc.</h3>  
             Investing instead of spending money can be a transformative decision. 
             By investing, you're not just saving for the future, but also laying 
             the foundation for financial security and generational wealth. Investing
             can help your money grow over time through the power of compound 
             interest, and potentially offering greater financial freedom and opportunities. 
             Indexes like $VTI can protect investors from volatility and indexes like $SPY can
             reward those who are willing to manage their risk and hold through volatility.
             It can be away to break the cycle of financial instability that many 
             first-generation students face. While it's essential to cover immediate 
             needs, consider allocating a portion of your income toward investments 
             like stocks, bonds, or retirement accounts. This disciplined approach 
             can help you achieve long-term goals, provide a safety net, and open doors 
             to a more stable and prosperous future.

             <h3>Building credit</h3>  
             Apply for a credit card if you have a steady source of income or a plan to 
             repay the charges. Once you have a card, create a budget to track your expenses
             and ensure you can cover your monthly payments. Always pay your bills on time 
             to avoid late fees and negative impacts on your credit score. Aim to keep your
             credit utilization (the ratio of your credit card balance to your credit limit)
             below 30% to maintain a healthy credit score. Lastly, use your credit card for 
             essential expenses and emergencies, avoiding unnecessary purchases that can 
             lead to high balances and debt accumulation. Responsible credit card usage in 
             college can help you build a positive credit history and set you up for 
             financial success after graduation.
